# Infrastructure Alert Intelligence Dashboard - Final Report

## Project Overview
The Infrastructure Alert Intelligence Dashboard is a full-stack application designed to reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for infrastructure alerts. The system models infrastructure as a dynamic graph, applies advanced algorithms for analysis, and uses machine learning to predict deployment risks.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Alert Dashboard**: Monitors and displays infrastructure alerts with high visibility
- **Dynamic Graph Visualization**: Interactive visualization of infrastructure components and their relationships
- **Impact Analysis**: Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to identify affected components
- **Failure Domain Detection**: Uses Union-Find algorithm to identify connected failure domains
- **Deployment Risk Prediction**: ML-based prediction of deployment risks with recommendations
- **High-Contrast UI**: Optimized for clarity in operations environments

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Flask, Python, Kafka
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, D3.js
- **Algorithms**: BFS, Union-Find
- **Machine Learning**: Gradient Boosting for risk prediction
- **Data Storage**: JSON-based data store with Kafka for real-time messaging

## Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
The backend is implemented as a modular Flask application with the following components:
- API endpoints for alerts, infrastructure, analysis, and predictions
- Kafka integration for real-time data streaming
- Graph analysis service with BFS and Union-Find algorithms
- ML-based deployment risk prediction service

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is implemented as a React application with TypeScript and the following components:
- Redux state management for application-wide state
- D3.js visualization for infrastructure graph
- Material-UI components with a custom high-contrast theme
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates

### Algorithm Implementation
- **BFS Algorithm**: Implemented for impact analysis to identify affected components when an issue occurs
- **Union-Find Algorithm**: Implemented for failure domain detection to identify connected components
- **ML Model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor for deployment risk prediction

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Approach
- **API Testing**: Validated all backend API endpoints
- **Real-Time Flow Testing**: Tested alert propagation from Kafka to UI
- **UI Responsiveness Testing**: Measured performance and responsiveness of the frontend

### Validation Results
