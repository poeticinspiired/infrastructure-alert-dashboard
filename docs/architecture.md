# System Architecture and Technology Stack

## Overall Architecture

The Infrastructure Alert Intelligence Dashboard follows a microservices-based architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Kafka Cluster**: Acts as the central message bus for all real-time alerts and infrastructure updates
- **Kafka Connectors**: Adapters to ingest data from various monitoring systems
- **Data Validation Service**: Ensures data quality and proper formatting

### 2. Backend Services
- **Flask API Server**: Core REST API service for frontend communication
- **Alert Processing Service**: Processes and enriches incoming alerts
- **Graph Analysis Service**: Implements BFS and Union-Find algorithms for infrastructure modeling
- **ML Prediction Service**: Handles deployment risk prediction
- **Historical Data Service**: Manages historical data for trend analysis

### 3. Frontend Application
- **React Application**: Single-page application with TypeScript
- **D3.js Visualization Engine**: Renders the infrastructure graph
- **Redux State Management**: Manages application state and real-time updates
- **Theme Provider**: Implements high-contrast UI theme

### 4. Data Storage
- **Time-Series Database**: For storing alert history and metrics (InfluxDB)
- **Graph Database**: For storing infrastructure relationships (Neo4j)
- **Document Store**: For storing configuration and metadata (MongoDB)

### 5. DevOps & Monitoring
- **Containerization**: Docker for service packaging
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for service management
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Data Flow

1. **Alert Generation**:
   - Infrastructure components generate alerts
   - Alerts are published to Kafka topics

2. **Alert Processing**:
   - Alert Processing Service consumes alerts from Kafka
   - Alerts are enriched with additional context
   - Processed alerts are stored in the Time-Series Database
   - Alert updates are published back to Kafka for real-time updates

3. **Graph Analysis**:
   - Graph Analysis Service maintains the infrastructure model
   - BFS algorithm traverses the graph to identify affected components
   - Union-Find algorithm identifies connected failure domains
   - Analysis results are published to Kafka

4. **ML Prediction**:
   - ML Prediction Service analyzes historical deployment data
   - Risk scores are calculated for planned deployments
   - Predictions are published to Kafka and stored

5. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Frontend subscribes to Kafka topics via WebSocket
   - Real-time updates are pushed to the UI
   - D3.js renders the infrastructure graph with alert status

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - All services are designed to be stateless
   - Kubernetes enables automatic scaling based on load
   - Kafka partitioning allows parallel processing

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Time-series data is sharded by time
   - Graph database uses partitioning for large infrastructure models
   - Read replicas for high-query workloads

3. **Frontend Performance**:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Efficient D3.js rendering with WebGL acceleration
   - Pagination and virtualization for large datasets

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - OAuth2 integration for enterprise environments

2. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - CORS configuration

3. **Data Security**:
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Data anonymization for sensitive information

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Local Docker Compose setup
   - Mock Kafka producers for testing

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Kubernetes cluster with reduced resources
   - Integration with test data sources

3. **Production Environment**:
   - Multi-zone Kubernetes deployment
   - High-availability Kafka cluster
   - Database replication and backups

## System Requirements

1. **Compute Resources**:
   - Minimum 4 CPU cores per service
   - 8GB RAM per service instance
   - 100GB storage for databases

2. **Network Requirements**:
   - Low-latency connection between services
   - Bandwidth for real-time data streaming
   - Public endpoints for frontend access

3. **Monitoring Requirements**:
   - CPU, memory, and disk usage
   - Request latency and throughput
   - Error rates and log volume
   - Custom metrics for business KPIs
