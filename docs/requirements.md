# Infrastructure Alert Intelligence Dashboard Requirements

## Project Overview
The Infrastructure Alert Intelligence Dashboard is a full-stack application designed to reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for infrastructure issues by providing real-time alerts, intelligent analysis, and predictive capabilities. The dashboard will visualize infrastructure as a dynamic graph, apply machine learning for risk prediction, and present information in a high-contrast theme optimized for operations environments.

## Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Flask (Python), Kafka
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, D3.js
- **Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Union-Find
- **Machine Learning**: For deployment risk prediction

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Real-time Alert Monitoring
- Ingest and process alerts from various infrastructure components in real-time
- Categorize and prioritize alerts based on severity and impact
- Display alert status, history, and resolution progress
- Support filtering and searching of alerts

### 2. Infrastructure Visualization
- Model infrastructure components as a dynamic graph
- Visualize relationships and dependencies between components
- Highlight affected components during incidents
- Support zooming, panning, and focusing on specific infrastructure segments

### 3. Intelligent Analysis
- Implement BFS algorithm to traverse infrastructure components for impact analysis
- Use Union-Find algorithm to identify connected components and failure domains
- Correlate related alerts to identify root causes
- Track alert patterns over time

### 4. Deployment Risk Prediction
- Develop ML models to predict potential risks of deployments
- Analyze historical deployment data to identify patterns
- Provide risk scores for planned deployments
- Suggest optimal deployment windows

### 5. User Interface
- Design a high-contrast theme for clarity in operations environments
- Create responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Implement real-time updates without page refreshes
- Provide customizable dashboards for different user roles

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Dashboard updates should occur within 2 seconds of alert generation
- System should handle at least 100 concurrent users
- Support for thousands of infrastructure components and alerts

### 2. Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for the dashboard
- Graceful degradation during backend service disruptions
- Data persistence for historical analysis

### 3. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability for both frontend and backend
- Efficient handling of increasing infrastructure size
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### 4. Security
- Role-based access control
- Secure API endpoints
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## Data Requirements

### 1. Alert Data
- Timestamp
- Source component
- Alert type
- Severity level
- Description
- Current status

### 2. Infrastructure Data
- Component ID
- Component type
- Relationships to other components
- Health status
- Metadata (location, owner, etc.)

### 3. Deployment Data
- Deployment ID
- Components affected
- Timestamp
- Changes made
- Outcome (success/failure)
- Associated incidents

## User Roles and Personas

### 1. Operations Engineers
- Primary users who need to quickly identify and resolve issues
- Require detailed technical information and actionable insights

### 2. DevOps Teams
- Need to understand deployment risks and infrastructure health
- Focus on preventing issues before they occur

### 3. Management
- Require high-level overview of system health
- Interest in trends and patterns rather than individual alerts

## Integration Points
- Kafka for real-time data streaming
- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- CI/CD pipelines for deployment data
- Ticketing systems for alert management

## Future Enhancements
- Automated remediation suggestions
- Integration with ChatOps tools
- Mobile application for on-the-go monitoring
- Advanced anomaly detection algorithms
